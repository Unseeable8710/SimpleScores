# About
SimpleScores is a JSON and XML compatible score formatting system that came up with, for the purpose of being used to store score data in score editors. I recommend JSON for web-based editors (like [Noteflight](https://noteflight.com)) and XML for local editors (like [MuseScore](https://musescore.com)).
